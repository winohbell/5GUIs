# 5GUIs
This repository contains my inplementation of 5 tasks from [7GUIS](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/)
(React, Webpack, Babel, Scss)

## Usage
1. Run 'npm install' from the root. This installs the necessary dependencies for the service to run.
1. Run 'npm run build' from the root. This will bundle the React components and styling files into a single file by webpack and babel that is run as a script from the index.html file.
1. Open index.html, locate in client folder.
